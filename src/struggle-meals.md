# Struggle Meals

## Rice Bowl
- [Lao Gan Ma](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.laoganmausa.com/&ved=2ahUKEwiwk73PyIGOAxUkOkQIHbYOI6oQFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1QueVzKT4H6bKTFspXCqBa)
- Soy Sauce
- Some protien (fried egg, spam, lunchmeat)

## Chickpea Bowl
- Can of chickpeas
- Garlic (leaving this in big bits keeps it from over cooking)
- Olive oil
- Some flavorful sauce or seasoning
- Optional fried egg
- Optional whatever herbs you have around (although to me herbs don't scream struggle meal)
1. Fry the chickpeas in a generous amount of olive oil
2. Add the garlic when the chickpeas are halfish way done
3. Add seasonings
4. Add sauce as applicable right before you take it out of the pan
5. Fry the egg in the same pan
