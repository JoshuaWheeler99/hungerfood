# Roasted Potatoes
Everyone loves good roasted potatoes, and yet bad roasted potatoes abound, what gives?

Good roasted potatoes have an additional step (boiling), an amount of oil that makes some people uncomfortable, and fresh herbs.

This [Adam Ragusea video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6kcANnAJSo) is excellent, a lot of the technique is discussed and justified in it.

## Ingredients
- Roasting potatoes, I like Yukon Gold
- Oil, I love extra virgin olive oil here
- A fresh herb. Thyme, rosemary, or something else, fresh really makes a difference here
- Garlic, in the skin still

## Advice
- Salt the potato boiling water heavily, it is hard for the salt to penetrate into the potato, but it is important it does so
- Boil them until you are worried they will fall apart. The outsides should create a mushy slurry that coats the potatoes when you combine with the oil, garlic, herbs
- Don't be afraid to use a lot of oil. The oil in the slurry is the key to making it get golden and crispy before it burns
- Beware overcrowding in the baking dish, it will have negative effects on cook time and crispiness

## Method
1. Cut potatoes however you like. Thicker will take longer to cook and has less surface area to crisp, but is less likely to fall apart and allows you to fit more potato in the same dish.
1. Put the potatoes in a pot, fill the pot with cold water, then boil
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F
1. Drain potatoes and let them steam off moisture for a minute or so.
1. Combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix them so that they are well incorporated, being careful to not entirely destroy the potatoes in the process.
1. Transfer to a sheet pan, and put in the oven
1. Roast until deep golden brown and crispy, 45min - 1.5hr probably, keep an eye on it.
