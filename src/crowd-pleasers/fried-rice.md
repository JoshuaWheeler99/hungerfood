# Fried Rice
This is a wonderful dish to have in your back pocket because it is quick to throw together and is super tasty even when thrown together. However, because fried rice is typically thrown together, it makes unusually good fried rice stand out that much more.

Now don't worry my fried rice advice will not make it take much longer to cook at all. My keys three:
1. Bacon fat (adds smokiness, fakes wok hei)
1. MSG
1. Bonito flakes (this + MSG is 8x more savory than pure MSG, and also helps avoids the taste of too much MSG)

## Ingredients
- Garlic and/or shallot
- Left over rice
- Bacon fat
- Some other fat as well if desired (if you use a lot of oil, it may be possible that exclusively using the bacon fat will result in too much bacon flavor, the smokiness is there for depth, its not the star of the show)
- Ginger
- Sambal Olek (optional)
- Soy sauce
- Egg(s)
- Additional protein (optional)
- MSG
- Bonito flakes

## Advice
- I cook this in a dutch oven because that lets me get it really hot and stir wildly
- Pre-prepping before cooking is really nice for this, because it comes together quick
- Reserving half your garlic until the end then adding lets you get the best of both cooked and more fresh garlic.

## Method
- Cut garlic and/or shallot
- Grate or finely chop ginger
- Scramble eggs, with salt and a lil fat
- Cook Shallots in bacon fat until they start to go translucent
- Once that happens, go in with the ginger, garlic, and S
sambal
- As soon as that is fragrant, add the rice and stir fry
- Add the soy sauce and more oil if needed here
- Fry rice
- Once you are happy with the rice, make room in the bottom of the pan and cook your eggs
- Once those are cooked, stir them into the rice
- Finally, season with the reserved garlic, MSG, bonito flakes, salt, and soy sauce to taste.
