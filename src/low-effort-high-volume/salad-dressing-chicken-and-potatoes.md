# Salad Dressing Chicken and Potatoes
So I think this originated as an [old Kraft recipe](https://www.kraftheinz.com/kraft-salad-dressing/recipes/506026-one-pan-chicken-and-potato-bake), but when I found it, it kinda blew my mind. You can make so much yummy food so cheap and so easily.


## Ingredients
- Bone in (preferably skin on) Chicken
- Potatoes (I use Yukon Gold)
- Onion (skip if you don't like slimy onions, I personally love them)
- Italian salad dressing (I used Kraft Zesty Italian)
- Italian seasoning
- Parmesan (optional)
- Red Pepper Flakes (optional)

## Advice
- Covering is important to ensure the chicken doesn't blister too early and then burn
- Uncovering is also key because it lets you get crispy chicken skin, although this is less precious for meal prep
- If your baking dish doesn't have a lid and you don't wanna use foil you can use a sheet pan

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F
1. Cut potatoes into wedges
1. Cut onions into quarters or eights and separate the layers
1. Combine all ingredients in a baking dish
1. Stir everything together until it is well combined
1. Cover baking dish and bake for 30 minutes
1. Uncover baking dish and bake for 30 more minutes
