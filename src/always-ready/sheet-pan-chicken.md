# Sheet Pan Chicken
You can eat this chicken by itself (like chicken nuggets) or use it as the protein in a bowl or wrap.

Keep the chicken in the freezer and get good at defrosting to always have this meal on the ready.

This is heavily inspired by [this](https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/loaded-chipotle-chicken-snack-wrap) Ethan Chlebowski recipe.

## Ingredients
- Powerful spice blend (I have had great luck with generic poultry seasoning, middle eastern BBQ seasoning, and chiles in adobo from a can that have been minced)
- Mayo (you can use a healthier oil if you want, but it will likely not do as good of a job adhering the spice to the chicken)
- Boneless skinless chicken thighs. This will turn out bad if you use light meat.

## Advice
- Put a lot of mayo and a lot of your spice blend on the chicken. The mayo is doing double duty here as both a cooking oil and as a medium to get the spice blend to adhere to the chicken.
- The chicken will likely stick to the sheet pan a bit. This will result in good flavor once they are scraped off, but prolly use a well seasoned pan rather than a beautiful pan.
- Beware over-crowding the sheet pan, this will have impacts on crispiness.

## Method
1. Cut chicken thighs into 1-2in cubes.
1. Put chicken thighs into a bowl. Coat them in mayo and spice mix.
1. Move an oven shelf to the top, then put the broil on high. Let it heat up for a bit before putting the chicken in.
1. Spread chicken thighs out on the sheet pan. Place under broiler until they have nice crispy bits.
