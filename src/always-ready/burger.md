# Burger
This recipe is not a ground breaking burger recipe. It is  a passable burger recipe that keeps indefinitely, and thus is available whenever you NEED it.

All the ingredients here have an extremely long shelf life if stored properly, plus you can throw in any fun perishables you have lying around. The ingredients here are a minimum baseline. Feel empowered to experiment.

It is not lost on me that long shelf life == lots of preservatives == not super healthy, but that is the price of convenience here. You could also swap to a healthier cheese alternative and find a healthy mayo if you are bothered, but those are also two of the most important ingredients, so choose wisely.

 ## Ingredients
- Frozen burger patties
- American cheese, (on brand encouraged, I have had bad experiences with off brand AC)
- Buns (fresh or frozen)
- Mayo
- Brown mustard
- Umami bomb, good options:
  - [TJ's mushroom powder](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/tjs-mushroom-company-multipurpose-umami-seasoning-blend-063804) <- this stuff is really good on the burger, highly recommend
  - Ketchup

## Advice
- Early versions of the burger were bland. This was mitigated using the mushroom powder, but the real fix was to salt the patty more and not skimp on mayo.
- The bun can make or break a burger. I get brioche buns and they treat me right.
- Beware grease splatter!

## Method
1. Cook the burger patty to the box instructions, except make sure to salt (pepper too if you want) each side of the patty at some point in the cooking process. I salt the pan before I put the patty in, and then I salt the top of the patty right after I put it in.
1. Meanwhile, toast the bun if you like then put mayo and mustard on the top and bottom buns. I also mix in  That is optional, but any umami bomb you can add to the sauce is helpful. Ketchup can help here too if you find your burger lacking in flavor.
  1. Once the patty is almost done, put the cheese one the patty to melt.
  1. Assemble, feel free to add whatever you want.
